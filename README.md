# Exploring Machine Learning for Music Classification

1) The 'Models' notebook consists of all the Experiments with the ML algorithms

2) The 'Data Preparation' notebook consists of loading all the data, extracting features, finding outliers and feature selection
The audio files were downloaded from http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html

3) In the notebooks "feature Extraction", various features are studied and derived for a test case.

4) The notebooks "STFT and windows_3" and "Sinusoids & DFT_2" has code/experiments based on lectures from the Coursera course(https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing/home/welcome). 
This notebook helps understand the maths and programming behind the feature extraction.
